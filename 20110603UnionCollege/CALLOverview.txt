  -INTELLIGENT COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING  (ICALL)

     - uses some kind of language model
         part of speech taggers, morphological analyzers, 
         natural language processors, thesauri etc

     - informed by some analysis of corpora
             frequency analysis of vocabulary and inflections
             annotated corpora  (automatic and/or manual annotation)
                part of speech, morphological analysis
                syntactic relations: dependency or XXXX constituency 
                semantic tagging
                alignment with translations
                 
     - for reading support-  vocabulary, grammar, references
     - for formative assessment- evolving user model of proficiency 
       versus target proficiency

    examples of ICALL:

    The Alpheios Project    http://alpheios.net

     - an open-source infrastructure to support a full range of 
       reading support and text analysis tools.

    Michael Walmsley: (University of Waikato) Flax-Reader  
       http://flax.nzdl.org/reader/files/Walmsley_NZCSRSC_2010.pdf

     - leveraging the academic version of Google Translate 
       into a reading support tool with pedagogical features.

    Detmar Meurers: (University of Tuebingen) Werti and Tagarella

     - enhancing authentic machine readable texts for pedagogical emphasis:

         Tagarella http://sifnos.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/tagarela/index.py/main

    Trudi Heift: (Simon Fraser University)  E-Tutor. 
    http://www.e-tutor.org:8080/public/legal/TermsOfUse.jsp

     - a full e-tutor for German that is already being used as a platform
       for CALL research.

    Noriko Nagata:  (University of San Francisco)  Robo-Sensei
       http://usf.usfca.edu/japanese/RSdemo/preRSfiles/Robo-Sensei.htm

     - a full e-tutor for Japanese that is already being used as a 
       platform for CALL research.

    ############

    The future of CALL:

        can provide a stable platform for research to address some of the
            perennial questions in language learning: eg optimal interval
            for reviewing vocabulary words; importance of individual differences            in language learning, etc.

        can provide a stable platform for going beyond traditional teaching
            methods, for self-initiated learning, formative assessment and
            various "gamification" approaches.
