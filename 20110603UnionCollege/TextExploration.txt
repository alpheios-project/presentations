COMPUTER-ASSISTED TEXT EXPLORATION- 
    CORPUS LINGUISTICS, 
    COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS

    New Corpora- Today the availability of 
        - much larger machine-readable corpora
        - and much more varied content- (with the potential for near term 
              availability of all text from all periods and genres 
              in all languages)
        is transforming corpora from resources used chiefly by linguists
        to fundamental resources for research in all the humanities.
        Examples of corpus resources can be found at:

    New Analytic Tools- The new corpora are inspiring rapid development of
        new text mining applications.  For recent annotated lists of
        concordance and text analysis software see:

    PEDAGOGY

      Pedagogical Use of Corpora in Language Learning

         eg find similar  vocabulary, grammar
            interactive alignment
            interactive treebank completion
            answer questions about incompletely understood distinctions
                  diction, grammar, etc

         For a recent overview with practical examples of "corpus based 
         discovery learning" (with students of German) see:

    RESEARCH
  
         Linguistic

            Tracing the development and interactions of languages throughout
              history, vocabulary, syntax, prosody, stylistics etc

            Testing specific theories of language acquisition and use

         Digital Humanities in general: Literature, History, Philosophy and
            the Social Sciences- psychology, anthropology, sociology...

            Answering questions of author attribution, 
                sequence of compositions etc

            Following patterns of influence and their gradual transformation
                in quantitative terms- "data driven" cultural history  and
                sociology of knowledge.

            Testing controversial and provocative suggestions in the
                history of culture and sociology of knowledge- eg
                parallels among the arts, and betweens arts and sciences.

            Identifying unsuspected cultural patterns of parallel 
                development or influence. 

            modeling the information flow within cultures- and thus gradually
                developing a dynamic model of cultural structure and change
                that can shed light also on the dynamic of the individual
                within the culture.

            An example of a research organization focussed on exploiting the
            new resources is the Harvard Cultural Observatory.
            http://www.culturomics.org/home

            Similar organizations and institutes can be expected to focus on
            specific subject areas where very careful control of search 
            vocabulary can be developed effectively. One would expect the 
            history of science, technology and medicine to yield results 
            before many other branches of learning because of their relatively
            standardized and concrete vocabulary. Universities and colleges 
            with strong technical faculties could leverage this expertise 
            to illuminate the historical development of these disciplines
            and their roles within their larger culture.
